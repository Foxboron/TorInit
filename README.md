TorInit
=======

Helps you generate a sane torrc file.
  
Idea:  
The templates will hold the required values specefied by `options.yaml`.
`options.yaml` will hold teh default configuration, recommendation based on 
template and try achive this in a dynamic way. Leaving little to being hard
coded thus easier to change and keep updated with the current settings 
available in tor.
